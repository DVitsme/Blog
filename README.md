#The point of this application is two fold

1. The First is to continue honing my skills with express and mongodb I think i have a pretty good understanding of basic CRUD applications with the exception of delete routes. There has to be a better way then the way I am currently attacking it.

2.The second part is that between EJS and PUG I find EJS to be a hell of a lot easier to write and implement, it just comes naturally to me. So with that in mind I have to write this project in PUG. Can't get better if I never pratice it right :)

1.0.0 The version will be done by each time I push to github mainly as a way to remember where i am in this project and what I have already done.

-Set up folder structure
-Set up all files for routes but i have not yet linked all routes together
    note** I want to figure how how to dynamically generate these routes. No one at reddit is sitting there had coding every /r/ route and neither should I ill have to read up on that tomorrow.
-Installed bootstrap using bower
-Set up mongoose and imported some dummy data to play with using the shell.
